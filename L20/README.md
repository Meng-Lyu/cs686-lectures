# Task A #
Follow the Google Docs.

# Task B #
Follow the Google Docs.

# Task C #
Follow the Google Docs (and come back here and read about `Task D` when you are ready to run your first Dataflow job).

# Task D #

- Check out the code from this repo (specifically, you need `L20/java`).
- Execute the main method from Eclipse or intelliJ. Or you can do it from command-line (do `$ gradle run` under `L20/java/dataflow` directory).
- If you get an error message like the one in https://github.com/cs-rocks/cs686-lectures/blob/master/L20/java/dataflow/resources/logs01.txt, then you either didn't follow the instructions from earlier steps or you didn't set up your GCP Credentials properly (see Lab 06 "Java Task" again). If either of these two applies, then you should re-read the instructions and follow them. 
- If your job runs successfully, then you will be able to see it from the Dataflow Web Console page (after a while, because your machine will need to upload many files to your GCS bucket.
