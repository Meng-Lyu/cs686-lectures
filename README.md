# cs686-lectures

## Lecture 02 code is available along with additional examples.
 - Also, for the sake of sample code, proto-generate java file (Common.java) is included, which is normally not included in labs or projects. 
 
 ## Lecture 04 code is available (draft)
 - Consider this initial code a draft, as I may change the contents before lecture. Once the code is finalized, I'll update this README.
